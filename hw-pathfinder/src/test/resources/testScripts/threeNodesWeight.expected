# Test findPath in a three-nodes map where the shorties path contains two segments.
created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph
added node C to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 3.000 from A to C in graph
added edge 1.000 from B to C in graph

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 1.000
B to C with weight 1.000
total cost: 2.000
