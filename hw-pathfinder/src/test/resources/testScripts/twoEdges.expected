# Test findPath between two nodes with multiple edges
created graph graph

added node A to graph
added node B to graph

added edge 1.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 2.000 from A to B in graph
added edge 3.000 from B to A in graph
added edge 4.000 from B to A in graph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
path from B to A:
B to A with weight 3.000
total cost: 3.000
