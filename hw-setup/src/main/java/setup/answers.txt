1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
It failed the test because it considered 0 as a negative number. I changed "if(n <= 0)" to "if(n < 0)"
to include 0 in non-negative numbers.


2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
I failed testBaseCase because it's supposed to return 1 if n equals 0, but instead, it throws an
exception. I fixed the issue by changing "if(n <= 0)" to "if(n < 0)" to include 0 in non-negative numbers, so
that it could process the base case.


3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
It failed the testInductiveCase since 1: it's supposed to run the inductive case when n == 2, but it falsely returns
one; 2: we're supposed to add previous two adjacent numbers instead of subtracting one from the other one. I fixed the
issue by changing "if(n <= 2)"" to "if(n < 2)" and "return getFibTerm(n - 1) - getFibTerm(n - 2)" to
 "return getFibTerm(n - 1) + getFibTerm(n - 2)".

 I changed contents in BallContainer to be public in order to access it in Box.java.
